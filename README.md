# API Specification Propaganda Posters
This is a project to create propaganda posters for API specifications. It would be nice to have motivational and inspirational posters that help folks get behind API specifications for meaningful purposes.

Possible Posters:

- The API Lifecycle
- Common Vocabulary
- Importance of API Documentation
- Securing APIs

IF you have an idea feel free to add to the list here with a PR, or submit an issue to help move forward the idea. We are looking for artists and sponsors to help make this happen. We are using this README to manage this project, and Github issues to manage the conversation and all of the work that occurs around defining all of the areas of this work.
