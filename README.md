# API Specification Propaganda Posters
This is a project to create propaganda posters for API specifications. It would be nice to have motivational and inspirational posters that help folks get behind API specifications for meaningful purposes.

Possible Posters:

- The API Lifecycle
- Common Vocabulary
- Importance of API Documentation
- Securing APIs

IF you have an idea feel free to add to the list here with a PR, or submit an issue to help move forward the idea. We are looking for artists and sponsors to help make this happen.
